# GA-Project1-MemoryGame

For my first project at General Assembly, I have created a memory/concentration game. 

**Motivation**
My general motivation for choosing a memory/concentration game was to master the logic of retrieving values and comparing them. I felt like it was something I could accomplish in the amount of time given

**User Stories & Wireframes**

*User Stories*
When the player presses “start,” 20 cards will appear and the timer will begin counting down from 30 seconds. By clicking an individual card, it will flip over to reveal the photo on the other side. The player will then attempt to select the matching card. If the next card selected matches, both cards will remain showing their photo. If the next card selected does not match, both cards will be turned over again. The game concludes once all the cards have been matched or when the timer reaches 0. To win, all cards must be matched.

1. Liana's Breakout Room - everyone who passed through just to say hi or review some code, you all helped me not only with my code, but also given me the camaraderie I needed to get through it!

Future Development
  * Add multiple rounds to populate more cards
  * Add more CSS styling to animate the flipping over of the cards and give it a more upscale look
  * Fix bug that you can continue to click on cards after they have already been flipped over
